<h3>THE DEVIL'S DUE.</h3>

<p class="blockquote">A priest tells how, in his youth, a church was built by the
free labour of love&mdash;as was men's wont in those days; and how
the stone and wood were paid for by one who had grown rich

<h3>APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.</h3>

<div class="line i2h">What does Apollo bid his servants do?"</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i0h">The Oracle replied&mdash;and straight returning</div>
<div class="line i0h">To Cymé ran the messengers fleet-footed,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Brought to the citizens the Sun-god's answer:</div>
<div class="line i2">"Apollo bids you yield to Persia's will".</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i0h">So when the men of Cymé heard the answer,</div>
<div class="line i0h">They set in hand at once to yield their suppliant,</div>
<div class="line i0h">But Aristodicus, loved of the city,</div>
<div class="line i2h">Withstood their will,&mdash;and thus to them spake he.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i0f">"Your messengers have lied&mdash;they have made merry</div>
<div class="line i0h">In their own homes, they have not sought Apollo;</div>
<div class="line i0h">The god in Branch&#301;dæ had never counselled</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i0f">"Wait. I, myself, with others of your choosing,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i0h">So, by the bright bay, under the blue heavens,</div>
<div class="line i0h">A second time to Branch&#301;dæ they journeyed,</div>
<div class="line i0h">A second time beneath the purple shadows</div>
<div class="line i2h">Passed through the laurels to Apollo's fane.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<div class="line i0h">And she demands him, but we dare not yield him,</div>
<div class="line i2h">Until we know what thou wouldst have us do.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i0f">"Our arm is weak against the power of Persia,</div>
<div class="line i0h">The foe is strong, and our defences slender;</div>
<div class="line i0h">Yet, Lord, not yet have we been bold to render</div>
<div class="line i2h">Him who has come, a suppliant, to our gates."</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i0h">So the Cyméan spake. Apollo answered:</div>
<div class="line i0f">"Yield ye your suppliant&mdash;yield him to the Persians".</div>
<div class="line i0h">Then Aristodicus bethought him further,</div>
<div class="line i2h">And in this fashion craftily he wrought.</div>

<div class="line i0h">All round the temple, in the nooks and crannies</div>
<div class="line i0h">Of carven work made by man's love and labour,</div>
<div class="line i0h">In perfect safety, by Apollo guarded,</div>
<div class="line i2h">The swallows and the sparrows built their nests.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i0h">And all day long their floating wings made beauty</div>
<div class="line i0h">About the temple and the whispering laurels,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i0h">Now round the temple went the men of Cymé,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Tore down the nests and snared the building swallows,</div>

<div class="line i2h">The anger of the immortal gods made night.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i0h">Then from the hid shrine of the inner temple</div>
<div class="line i0h">Came forth a voice more beautiful than music,</div>
<div class="line i0h">More terrible than thunder and wild waters,</div>
<div class="line i2h">And more to be desired than summer sun.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i0f">"O thou most impious of all impious mortals,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Why hast thou dared defy me in my temple,</div>
<div class="line i0h">And torn away the homes of those who trust me,</div>
<div class="line i2h">Taken my suppliants from me for thy prey?"</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i0h">Then Aristodicus stood forth, and answered:</div>
<div class="line i0f">"Lord, is it thus <em>thy</em> suppliants are succoured,</div>
<div class="line i0h">What time thy Oracle bids men of Cymé</div>

<div class="line i2h">With all the song and sorrow of the world:&mdash;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i0f">"Yea, I do bid you yield him, that so sinning</div>

<h3>RUCKINGE CHURCH.</h3>

<p class="blockquote">"And we said how dreary and desolate and forlorn the church
was, and how long it was since any music but that of the moth-eaten
harmonium and the heartless mixed choir had sounded
there. And we said: 'Poor old church! it will never hear any
true music any more'. Then she turned to us from the door of
the Lady Chapel, which was plastered and whitewashed, and
had a stove and the Evangelical Almanac in it, and her eyes
were full of tears. And, standing there, she sang 'Ave Maria'&mdash;it
was Gounod's music, I think&mdash;with her voice and her face like
an angel's. And while she sang a stranger came to the church
door and stood listening, but he did not see us. Only we saw
that he loved her singing. And he went away as soon as the
hymn was ended, we also soon following, and the church was left
lonely as before."&mdash;<i>Extract from our Diary</i>.</p>
